Address: University of Johannesburg, Kingsway Avenue and, University Rd, Auckland Park, Johannesburg, 2092, South Africa
Email Address: tevin@uj.ac.za & dvanderhaar@uj.ac.za
Principal investigator: Tevin Moodley (tevin@uj.ac.za)

Dataset Setup:
Videos collected from YouTube search of First-Class International Cricket Test Match highlights
The investigation was to select various batsmen who performed the lateral and straight backlifts, ten batsmen that exhibited the straight backlift and ten batsmen that demonstrated the lateral backlift. The batsman selected for the:

Straight backlift; Babar Azam, Themba Bavuma, Rahul Dravid, JP Duminy, Dean Elgar, Mahela Jayawardene, Ajinkya Rahane, Joe Root, Rory Burns, Ben Stokes, and David Warner. 

Sateral backlift; AB de Villiers, Hashim Amla, Quintin de Kock, Faf du Plessis, Kevin Pieterson, Kumar Sangakara, Brian Lara, Ricky Ponting, Steve Smith, and Virat Koli.

Using the Labelbox editor, each object within the scene is labelled, allowing for easier isolation and extraction of the batsman in each frame. The frame used for constructing the dataset was when the bowler is about to release the ball towards the batsman.
